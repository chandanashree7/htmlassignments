					<h2>An Extraordinary Legacy of Exploration</h2>
					<p>
						National Geographic Expeditions, the travel program of the National Geographic Society, was founded on the same belief in the importance of exploration that distinguishes the Society's 125-year history. Launched in 1999, National Geographic Expeditions now operates hundreds of trips each year, spanning all seven continents and more than 60 destinations.<br><br>
						Since its founding in 1888, the Society has developed incredible resources-from its network of experts, contacts, and Society-sponsored researchers all over the globe, to the top-tier editorial staff of National Geographic and National Geographic Traveler magazines, and the books, maps, and film and television divisions. National Geographic Expeditions taps these resources to create unique and authentic expeditions to fascinating parts of the world.<br><br>
						As part of the National Geographic Travel group, National Geographic Expeditions aims to fulfill the Society's mission to inspire people to care about the planet by providing meaningful opportunities to explore it. Proceeds from all travel programs support the Society's efforts to increase global understanding through exploration, education and scientific research.<br><br>
						National Geographic Expeditions span the globe and are designed to reflect our travelers' broad spectrum of interests. We travel on land, aboard small ships, along classic train routes, and in the comfort of a private jet, and we offer special trips for photographers, students, families, and independent travelers. When you travel with us on an expedition, you'll enjoy boundless opportunities to be surrounded by natural wonders and exotic wildlife, to explore celebrated archaeological sites, to learn about different cultures and share in local traditions. A National Geographic expert or expert team accompanies most expeditions, sharing their knowledge and passion for a region and making each experience enriching and unforgettable.
